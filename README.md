## What is Text Summarization?
- Text summarization is the process of condensing a given text while retaining its essential information. 
- It involves extracting key sentences or phrases to create a concise summary that captures the main ideas. 
- Summarization can be done through extractive methods, which select and rearrange existing sentences, or abstractive methods, which generate new sentences to convey the summarized content
